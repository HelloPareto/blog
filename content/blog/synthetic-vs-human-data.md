The AI community often talks about synthetic and human data as if we have to choose between them. This oversimplified view misses what's really happening in modern machine learning systems, where both types of data play important roles. In this article, we lay out an actionable strategy to optimize data collection for advancing AI models.


## Understanding human data's unique properties

Let's start with what makes human data special. When humans create data - whether it's through writing, speaking, or interacting with systems - they embed patterns that we still can't fully replicate. Think about how we change our tone of voice to show emotion, or how experts make decisions based on years of experience. These qualities aren't just missing labels in our datasets - they represent deep patterns in human behavior that our current AI systems struggle to understand.

Take speech as an example. A human can instantly tell if someone is being sarcastic, not just from their words but from subtle changes in their voice. Or consider how doctors make diagnoses - they're not just matching symptoms to diseases, they're drawing on countless patient interactions and subtle contextual clues that aren't captured in medical textbooks.

A 2024 paper, "Generative AI for Synthetic Data Generation: Methods, Challenges and the Future," discusses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. It emphasizes that while LLMs can generate contextually relevant text, the absence of domain-specific human data can hinder performance in specialized fields like healthcare and education.

As of today, there are areas where human data is still crucial:

- **Testing if AI tools work naturally with human users.**

- **Making complex decisions that depend on understanding context.**

- **Capturing how language actually evolves and changes.**

- **Understanding unwritten social rules and cultural knowledge.**

## The real value of synthetic data

This doesn't mean synthetic data isn't valuable. In fact, recent advances have made synthetic data incredibly useful for many tasks. Here's where synthetic data really shines:

- **Creating massive training datasets quickly and cheaply.**

- **Generating examples of rare situations that are hard to find in real data.**

- **Making sure our training data has an even distribution of different cases.**

- **Testing how systems handle specific variations in input.**

## Exploring key technical challenges

This combined approach brings up interesting technical challenges for researchers:

### Data quality assessment

- **How do we measure when human data adds unique value?**

- **What metrics can tell us if synthetic data is good enough for a specific task?**

- **How do we test if our systems are learning the right patterns?
**

### Pipeline design

- **How do we build systems that can effectively use both types of data?**

- **What's the best way to validate results from mixed data sources?**

- **How should we weight different data sources in training?**

### Understanding implicit knowledge

- **What parts of human behavior are hardest to synthesize?**

- **How do we capture expert knowledge that isn't written down?**

- **What role does cultural context play in our data?**

## Strategic recommendations for AI companies

Here's how AI companies can harness both data types to maximize model performance and accelerate innovation.

## 1. Invest in high-quality human data

Human data is indispensable for certain AI tasks, and companies must invest in high-quality, context-rich datasets. Here's how to make this investment count:

- **Identify key areas where human data is critical: ** These include tasks that require deep understanding of context, nuanced decision-making, or domain-specific knowledge. Examples include medical diagnoses, customer service interactions, and understanding social behaviors in different cultures.

- **Leverage expert contributions:**In specialized fields like healthcare, law, or engineering, collaborating with domain experts to create annotated datasets will improve model performance. Build partnerships with experts and crowdsource data where necessary.

- **Ensure diversity and representativeness:**Human data should reflect diverse perspectives and backgrounds to ensure models can handle various scenarios. This also ensures that AI systems do not amplify biases.

## 2. Balance synthetic and human data

While human data is valuable for certain tasks, synthetic data offers significant advantages in other areas. By intelligently combining both types, companies can achieve better outcomes. Here's how:

- **Use synthetic data for scalability:** Create large-scale datasets that might be impractical or too expensive to collect in real life. This is especially useful for tasks that require rare examples, such as detecting edge cases in security or healthcare.

- **Simulate rare events and anomalies:** Use synthetic data to simulate rare or dangerous events that don’t naturally occur frequently in real-world data. For example, you can simulate various climate change scenarios or create a wide variety of network traffic patterns for security testing.

- **Optimize for data diversity:** Synthetic data allows you to generate more balanced datasets, reducing the risk of bias and ensuring that AI models are not overfitting to one type of data.

## 3. Ensure effective data pipelines for mixed data

Creating AI systems that effectively use both synthetic and human data requires a well-designed data pipeline. Here’s what to focus on:

- **Design systems to seamlessly integrate both data types:** Build pipelines that can handle data coming from different sources, ensuring they complement each other without introducing noise or inconsistencies.

- ** Set validation mechanisms:**When mixing synthetic and human data, establish rigorous validation frameworks to ensure both data types align with the desired performance outcomes. Use human evaluation where synthetic data cannot be directly assessed.

## 4. Leverage synthetic data for pretraining

Synthetic data can be particularly useful for pretraining models, especially when high-quality human data is scarce. Here's how:

- **Use synthetic data for initial model training:**Pretrain models with synthetic data to teach basic concepts and patterns. For example, in NLP, you can train a model on a wide range of general text from synthetic sources to help it understand syntax and grammar.

- **Fine-tune with human data:** Once your model is pretrained, fine-tune it using human data to capture real-world nuances and contextual understanding. This is especially crucial for tasks like language translation, where cultural references matter.

## 5. Measure and improve the "humanness" of synthetic data

As synthetic data generation techniques improve, the challenge will be ensuring that this data reflects the richness of human behavior. Here's how companies can address this:

- **Develop metrics for human-like data:**Pretrain models with synthetic data to teach basic concepts and patterns. For example, in NLP, you can train a model on a wide range of general text from synthetic sources to help it understand syntax and grammar.

- **Continuously improve data generation models: ** Invest in generative models that can produce more realistic data, and continuously evaluate their performance against human benchmarks. Make adjustments as needed to ensure they are as realistic as possible.

## Future research directions

As synthetic data gets better, some tasks that needed human data will shift to using synthetic data instead. But this won't make human data obsolete - it will just change where we use it. Here's what researchers should focus on:

### Near-term priorities

Building better frameworks for deciding when to use each type of data

Creating training pipelines that can smoothly use both types of data

Developing better ways to validate synthetic data against human behavior

### Long-term research questions

How do we preserve important human patterns when generating synthetic data?

Can we create metrics to measure the "humanness" of our data?

What aspects of human behavior will always need real human data to understand?

For researchers and practitioners, this isn't just a theoretical discussion. It's about building better AI systems that can handle both structured tasks and human complexity. As we tackle harder problems in AI, this nuanced understanding of data will become even more important.
