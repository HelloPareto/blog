Weâ€™re thrilled to announce our BIG news. 

Introducingâ€¦

the all-newâ€¦

Pareto.AI ðŸŽŠ

## Why the change?

In March 2022, when we announced our [$4.5 million seed raise](https://pareto.ai/blog/our-seed-round), we vowed to be more than a virtual assistant. We challenged ourselves to be the best data collection, lead generation, and web research services provider by supercharging our team of data experts with powerful software. We did that to help businesses get the strategic data needed, custom-made, quality-assured, with quick turnarounds. 

Since then, weâ€™ve helped more than 600+ customers in industries such as:

- Airline and Aviation

- Advertising and Marketing

- Biotechnology

- Business

- Education

- Energy

- Entertainment

- Healthcare

- Hospitality

- Manufacturing

- Professional Services

- Transport

In all, **we completed over 7500 projects** and **saved customers over 400,000 hours** while they focused on more critical parts of their businesses. Not bad, eh?

* * *

But last November, a technology shift took place: OpenAI released an early demo of ChatGPT, a new generative AI tool that took the news and industry by storm. It was nothing like anyone had seen before, and companies everywhere rushed to incorporate AI into their tool stack and workflows. 

While AI tools are making automation easier, their abundance is also making it hard to find and choose the right solutions. As a result, cutting through the flood of options to distinguish between good and great advice and the most effective processes requires specialization and expertise.

Individual professionals, too, face a steep learning curve to build their own suite of productivity tools just to stay afloat and competitive. 

To make a perfect stormâ€¦wellâ€¦more perfect, websites are moving to prevent AI tools from accessing their data. That means that despite AIâ€™s new abilities, humans will always remain the go-between. For example, weâ€™ll use semi-automated tools to process data on webpages, debug broken automationsâ€”like 2FA, human verification, engineering AI promptsâ€”and so forth. As such, we at Pareto.AI believe that **even if most processes can be fully automated, human expertise will still be needed to get the best results from AI**.

* * *

So why did we change our domain and update our website?

To better reflect how we help you grow your business by enriching your data:

- We help you select, implement, and optimize workflows using new tools, including AI, to increase your efficiency.

- We assemble your extended team, supercharged by AI, to execute your project specs at a fraction of the time and resources of hiring freelancers or figuring out how to use the tools yourself.

You see, in todayâ€™s world of AI, we are more than a virtual assistant. We cut through the storm to help you stay at the forefront of innovation. In other words, **our new domain reflects our passion for helping businesses do more with help from our AI-powered data experts made ready for the age of AI**.

## What to expect on Pareto.AI (and whatâ€™s new)

If you havenâ€™t visited our website recently, you might notice that we have a new coat of paint. Our redesigned website is more than a visual upgrade, though. With improved navigation, responsive design, and interactive elements, our website streamlines the journey of getting to know Pareto.AI, our solutions, our mission, and our latest developments.

Rest assured, the heart and soul of Pareto remain unchanged. With Pareto.AI, youâ€™ll continue to receive the same exceptional service youâ€™ve come to love. Marketers, recruiters, entrepreneurs, and small business owners can still find niche influencers, source job candidates, search for investors, and much more. Plus, Pareto.AI is still only a Slack message away.

Also unchanged is our mission: 

- To democratize access to high-quality data andâ€¦

- To empower women around the world with meaningful work. 

Our team of data analysts, who are 100% women-led and operated, are still at the core of why we do what we do. We aim to help talented, overlooked, and underemployed women access high-growth careers in tech with flexible, remote jobs, world-class training, and a supportive community of peers. They embody the constant pillar, unwavering and ready to rise above any squall.

### The exciting news isâ€¦

**Weâ€™re focusing our offerings on data enrichment and [data labeling](https://pareto.ai/ai-data-labeling).** These services help use cases, such as building AI agents, chatbots, models, and feature updatesâ€”you name it. 

If youâ€™ve ever sourced data for these types of projects, you know that getting quality data can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly with some other providers. But with Pareto.AI, youâ€™ll be able to get started with zero hassle, lower commits, and initial results within 24 hours.

What does this mean in a nutshell?

**Pareto.AI is the go-to extended team for data labeling, collection, and enrichment projects for data-driven teams.** ðŸš€

## Thank you from all of us

Today marks a new era for us. Weâ€™ve become the go-to extended team for boosting your revenue, growing your business, and enriching your data-driven projects. The future is bright, and weâ€™re geared up to meet the ever-growing demands of todayâ€™s AI-native world.

Your support and trust have been the foundation of our growth. Weâ€™re stepping into a future filled with endless possibilities, and weâ€™re thrilled to have you at our side.
