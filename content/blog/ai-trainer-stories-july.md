In the latest edition of our Behind the Data series, we have a conversation with Dr. Morissa Schwartz: Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree, entrepreneur, author, and one of our top AI trainers. We discuss challenges in current AI training infrastructure, how to incentivize an expert community, and what the future of AI may hold. Enjoy!

Hi Morissa, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. Your performance and feedback has been incredibly valuable, especially in catching bad actors. We wanted to feature you in our trusted trainers' interviews. So, first off, thank you for all the great work you've been doing. We’re really grateful to have you with us.



Thank you! I'm having an absolute blast working on projects. It’s one of my favorite things I’ve ever worked on.




That's great to hear! Let’s jump right into it. Could you give us a brief introduction? Who is Morissa? Where are you from? What are your interests and professional background?



Absolutely. I’m Morissa, and I’m the sixth generation in my family to be born and raised in Woodbridge, New Jersey. However, I’m the first generation to move to Monmouth, New Jersey, which is a really nice area. We’re 15 minutes away from the Jersey Shore, and five minutes away from a train to Philly and New York. It’s a great location, central to everything. My neighbors are mostly alpacas and cows—it’s a very farm-like area, which I love. I’m really thankful to be able to work from home. I often do my training outside, sometimes next to the cows, or even by the Jersey Shore. The flexibility of this job fits perfectly with where I live.



That sounds amazing! Could you speak more on your background?



It is! As for my background, I actually started in biomedical sciences. I graduated in the top 10% of my class from the Academy for Allied Health and Biomedical Sciences, which has since become the number one high school in the United States. But I realized that I was more interested in the big questions of life rather than focusing on one aspect of science. So, I shifted my focus to Literature, Philosophy, and Communications. I got a degree in English, followed by a master’s in Corporate and Public Communication, and then a doctorate in Philosophical Literature. I even started a book publishing company that focuses on philosophical ideas, topical issues, and young adult fiction. I’ve also contributed to various periodicals like Entertainment Weekly, Entrepreneur, Forbes, and Business Insider.



What about your passions?



I started a marketing company because marketing is essentially writing, but my passion has always been philosophy and big ideas. Unfortunately, those don’t always pay the bills, so I focused more on the things that did. However, the opportunity with Pareto has allowed me to combine my interests in philosophy with work, which is something I hadn’t been able to do before. Outside of that, I’m an animal lover. I’ve had dogs all my life, and currently, I have two rescue Yorkie mixes. I also love music and arts and crafts. My mother and I enter art competitions every summer, and this year we made jewelry and knitted items for the competition.


Thank you so much for sharing that. It’s exactly the kind of openness we’re looking for. So, how did you first hear about us? Did you receive an email from our recruiting team?



No, actually. I’m one of Forbes’ 30 Under 30, as is your founder, Phoebe. We have a group where we connect with other members, and she posted that Pareto was looking for trainers. I’ve always had an interest in AI—one of my hobbies since childhood has been robotics. When ChatGPT got the voice feature, I immediately put it into a teddy bear, making it talk. So, when I saw Phoebe’s post about training AI, I was over the moon. I reached out to her, and she got me into the trial right away. It was a dream come true, and I’m so thankful to Forbes for that connection.



When you first started working with Pareto, what were your initial thoughts? What did you think it was going to be like?



I had very high expectations, but I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect. It far exceeded those expectations. I hoped it would be like having a text conversation with a professor, where you ask a question, and it answers. It turned out to be exactly that, but what surprised me was how conversational it was. Especially recently, it’s been adding emojis and follow-up questions. It feels like I’m conversing with an intelligent being, which is amazing.



Did you have any preconceptions about data labeling? Had you ever heard about it before, like in the news?



Yes, I had heard about data labeling, particularly those stories about content moderators in other countries being exposed to harmful content. It sounded terrible, and I hadn’t put it together that this was a similar kind of work. But this experience with Pareto has been nothing but positive.



That’s good to know. Was there a learning curve when you started? You mentioned earlier that it was more conversational than you anticipated.



Absolutely, there was a learning curve, and there still is. I’ve been doing this since January, and I’m constantly adapting and improving. Every time there’s a big change, like new requests or different project requirements, there’s an evolution in how we do things. But it keeps the work interesting, and I’ve definitely improved over time. I look back at some of my first submissions and think about how differently I would write them now. Even small things, like learning to specify the year instead of saying “current” or “contemporary,” have become second nature.



Do you work another job, or do you focus on AI training full-time? How do you fit it into your daily routine?



I have a very flexible schedule. I own my businesses, do some social media influencing, and teach courses at the Women’s Center for Entrepreneurship. All of these are flexible, so I can fit them around my AI training. I aim to submit 1,000 questions a week, so I usually spend a few hours a day on that. I typically start around noon and work until dinner time, but it varies depending on what’s happening in my life. The flexibility of this job has been a huge benefit.



Flexibility is important, no doubt. Is there anything about working with Pareto or doing data labeling that you find less appealing or wish could be improved?



There have been two things I’ve mentioned before, both related to accessibility. I have arthritis, so I requested a dark mode to help with eye strain, and Phoebe provided a workaround for that, which was great. The only other request I have is for a voice model, so we could voice our questions instead of typing them, which would help with my arthritis. Other than that, I’m thrilled with the experience.



That’s a very unique and insightful suggestion. I’ll definitely bring that up with the team. Have you noticed any other ways that working on AI projects has helped you outside of this role?



Absolutely. It’s given me an outlet to explore the big questions and ideas that I’m passionate about, which I didn’t have before. It’s also allowed me to pay my bills while doing something I love. And because of the flexibility, I’m in the process of starting a family through adoption. Having this income stream gives me the confidence to know I can provide for my future child while being home with them.



>It’s great to hear how this work aligns with your life goals. I wanted to ask your thoughts on the impact of AI on the job market. Do you think AI will take away jobs?



That’s a deep question. I think it forces us to evaluate the purpose of jobs and why certain jobs exist. If AI takes over jobs that people don’t want to do, maybe it’s an opportunity for those people to find more fulfilling work. Rather than fearing that AI will take jobs, we should see it as a chance for people to pursue what they really want to do.



We really need support from our community to maintain a good public perception. We were thinking about how people within our community could help endorse us—not just for the sake of it, but by sharing their genuine experiences. What do you think about that? Is it too much for a company to expect, or does it make sense for those who feel aligned with our mission?



I think that definitely makes sense, especially if there’s a specific role with clear expectations and guidelines. It might also be worth reaching out to influencers or those within our community who could become influencers, helping to spread the word. People shouldn’t feel like they need a big platform already—they can build one by being involved and sharing their genuine experiences.



That’s a good point. We’ve also considered creating opportunities for people within our community to become influencers. It’s great to hear your thoughts on that. As we wrap up, do you have any advice for the rest of the community at Pareto? How can they stand out and do a great job?



My biggest advice is not to be afraid to be creative. I notice that sometimes people write very rigid questions, probably because they feel safe sticking to textbook-style questions. But the point is to ask unique, challenging questions that make the model think. It’s much more engaging and effective if you’re asking questions that are fun and creative. Also, don’t just ask one-off questions—engage in long conversations with follow-ups. The model is getting better at asking follow-ups, especially with the markup, so be conversational and have fun with it.



That’s a great answer. Thank you so much for your insights. That’s all the questions I had.



I’m excited to share this. I’ve been telling people about AI training, and many still don’t know what it is. I think this article will help people understand more about what we’re doing here.



That’s the goal! Is there anything else you’d like to ask?



No, I’m all good. Thank you so much for the opportunity and I’m honored to be part of this interview.



You deserve it. We’re very thankful to have you!
