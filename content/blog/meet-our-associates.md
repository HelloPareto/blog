Pareto was founded to bridge the disconnect between economic opportunity and the capable talent that exists around the world. Today, we employ talented women from across the globe - giving them the chance to hone their professional skills without uprooting their lives in search of greater economic opportunity. 

Our associates are smart, strong, and inspiring. They bring diverse life and career experience to our rich team and community. Half of our team members are moms, one in four own their own business, and 100% are college-educated. By working at Pareto, these women are able to enjoy the benefits of remote work, spend time with family, and pursue their own ventures or graduate education.

Rather than growing our team via traditional recruiting efforts, most of our associates come from the extensive networks of other Pareto employees. Through this informal referral program, most new Pareto associates already know at least one current employee, reinforcing our strong culture of mentorship and mutual support between working women. Our team approaches their colleagues with the utmost respect and kindness, and this lays the foundation for Pareto's unique user experience.

### Sherbene

#### 📍 Her Story:

I am from Lumban, Laguna. I studied BS Nutrition at University of the Philippines Los Baños. Although it was not my first choice, I decided to pursue it after the first year as I’ve learned to love the course and people.

My first job was as a restaurant manager of a famous fast-food chain here in the Philippines, which was fun yet challenging at the same time. I was a bit young for a manager and some of my subordinates were older than me, which taught me a lot about working in a team. In the following years, I ventured into the marketing business, where I developed myself, my leadership and communication skills, and fostered my need for continuous growth.

A friend of mine who works at Pareto invited me to apply as well and the experience has been amazing. It aligns with my values and provides opportunities for personal growth. Our team helps one another achieve greater heights 🚀 in different aspects of life. And Pareto also rewards our hard work - I am now a Senior Associate. This has been a great opportunity for me to hone my skills and challenge myself to constantly improve! 🦸‍♀️

#### 💌 What She Loves:

I am a zombie movie addict 🧟‍♀️.

#### 💬 Her Quotable Quote:

“Opportunities are all around, but it is your choice to maximize them!” 

Since Pareto is mostly comprised of women (several of which are moms), it has inspired me to work better and multi-task more effectively. Pareto taught me that limits are just what we set in our minds. And what I love the most is: you can be yourself and express your thoughts freely!

### Anne

#### 📍 Her Story:

I was born and raised in Metro Manila, and I’m a graduate of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines Manila, where I earned a BS in Food Technology. Before Pareto, I worked at a well-known manufacturer of sauces and mixes in the Philippines, where I was a Food Safety Auditor for seven years. Now, I am a partner-in-training, and I've been with Pareto for 10 months - going on one year in May!

#### 💌 What She Loves:

I love to travel and my favorite travel activities are snorkeling 🤿 and island hopping 🏝.

#### 💬 Her Quotable Quote:

“Take courage and go beyond your limits. Along the way, you'll discover that you can do things you never knew you were capable of.”

### Vi

#### 📍 Her Story:

I grew up in Quezon City, and I attended Trinity University of Asia, where I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science. From there, I worked in the corporate world for over twenty years. My jobs included Customer Service, Technical Support, Training, and Information Technology. I decided to switch to remote work in order to spend more time with my family. I just started at Pareto three weeks ago, and I’m currently an Associate! 🙂

#### 💌 What She Loves:

I cannot fall asleep without listening to Harry Potter 🧙‍♂️⚡️ audiobooks. I have all seven books on my phone and I put that on every time I go to sleep 💤. It’s like listening to a bedtime story 🛌 📚.

#### 💬 Her Quotable Quote:

“Work-life balance is definitely non-negotiable when it comes to choosing a company.”


Pareto’s culture and its “family first” outlook is why I chose to apply for an Associate position. I’m definitely stoked that I’m part of a team where the people and the culture rock!
