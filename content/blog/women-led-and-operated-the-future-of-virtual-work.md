A [2012 research study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/09/120918121257.htm) found that women speak less than 75 percent as much as men when outnumbered on teams. In board meetings, leadership committees, and the executive level of organizations, women are oftentimes in the minority. The dramatic inequality makes it difficult for women to be viewed as influential and make their voices heard in the workplace.

Pareto is combating systemic underrepresentation by building an empowering women-led and operated community of data analysts. Our mission is to provide flexible, virtual work supported by an uplifting network of peers.

Since the pandemic, Pareto has helped more than a hundred women around the world upskill themselves as data analysts. Pareto data analysts can choose when they work, what projects they work on, and the specific skills they practice. Expert analysts support new hires with technical training, peer mentorship, and leadership opportunities. 50 percent of Pareto data experts are work-at-home moms. An additional 25 percent of Pareto team members have started their own businesses since joining Pareto’s community.

Pareto was founded by Phoebe Yao, a human-computer interaction researcher, Thiel Fellow, and Chinese-American immigrant. Phoebe’s immigrant experience inspired her to research systems for socioeconomic empowerment. After studying computer science, Phoebe dropped out of college to build Pareto and give underrepresented communities the tools they need to access meaningful work.

Today, Pareto is growing fast. Our dedication to the personal and professional growth of our team members has helped us scale our network and build strong expertise. This, along with our foundational culture of service enables us to provide exceptional customer experience and deliver the highest-quality, tailored data solutions.

We’re proud to be certified by the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council as a women-owned and operated business.
