After collaborating with incredible researchers and data workers, we are proud to announce a suite of data labeling, annotation, and evaluation services for AI businesses.

Our mission has always been to empower talented and diverse professionals in order to produce exceptional results for businesses. Transitioning to LLM fine-tuning is a natural step forward, where the profound impact of human feedback and expertise truly shines. While we continue to provide our business operations service, our core offering has now shifted towards AI training. 

Our commitment to being a collaboration-first platform and prioritizing high-quality data work gives us a distinct advantage in AI and LLM development. By placing elite data workers at the forefront of our operations, we ensure a more nuanced and accurate approach to data evaluation. This, in turn, leads to more robust and effective LLM models. After all, an AI model is only as good as the quality of data it has been trained on.

We have built a proprietary interface, capable of handling complex projects across modalities while supporting critical communication between data teams and researchers. This marks an exciting new chapter in our story, and we eagerly anticipate demonstrating our superior methodology for new customers.

## A multifaceted approach to AI advancement

Our services integrate our vetted experts' skills and experience in human guidance into every phase of model development. By collaborating with requesters on guidelines, QA, and skill vetting, we provide higher-value fine-tuning capabilities compared to other labeling services. The areas we specialize in include:

- RLHF for fine-tuning AI models

- Simple side-by-side reinforcement learning for early-stage LLM's

- Training AI models for unique original content generation

- Testing for LLM hallucination and creative hallucination inducement strategies

- Honesty and factuality training

- Content moderation and ethical AI development

- In-depth engine annotation

- Term relevancy and item fluency grading

- Language segmentation

- Computer vision training

- Data labeling and dataset creation

With multiple other services in our pipeline, this is only the beginning of what we hope to be a significant shift in AI training.

### Experience our new services first-hand

We are proud to announce that our new services are fully operational, and we have already begun projects with some of the most disruptive AI companies in the world, such as Character AI and Imbue.

Additionally, we've refreshed our homepage and website to better reflect our mission and offerings. We invite you to explore the site for profiles of our skilled data teams and partner testimonials. Make sure you check back regularly as we continue improving the experience for our community.
