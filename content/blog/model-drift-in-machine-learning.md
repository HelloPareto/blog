Imagine you have an AI model that predicts the popularity of songs based on data from music charts. When you first train the model, it uses data from recent hits—songs that have topped the charts in the past year. The model learns that upbeat pop songs with catchy choruses tend to be popular.

Now, think of this model as a fashion expert who knows the current trends. At first, the expert is great at predicting what styles will be in vogue because they’re familiar with what's popular now.

But musical tastes change over time. New genres emerge, and listener preferences shift. The once-popular upbeat pop songs might be replaced by a trend towards slow, acoustic ballads. If the model isn't updated with new data reflecting these changes, it will continue to predict that upbeat pop songs will be hits, even when they're not as popular anymore.

This is model drift. Just like the fashion expert needs to keep up with the latest trends to make accurate predictions, the AI model needs regular updates with new data to stay accurate and relevant. Without this, its predictions become outdated and less reliable.

## What is Model Drift, and Why Does it Happen?

Machine learning models are trained on historical data, but once they're deployed, they can gradually become outdated and less accurate. This phenomenon, known as model drift, occurs when the statistical characteristics of the training data change over time. As a result, the model's performance can degrade, making less reliable predictions than initially intended.

A [recent study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15245-z) by MIT and Harvard reveals that 91% of machine learning models degrade over time. This conclusion comes from experiments conducted on 128 pairs of models and datasets.

That said, there are several reasons why machine learning models can drift over time.


- **Changing Data Patterns:** Over time, the patterns and relationships in the data can evolve. For example, consumer preferences might shift, leading to different purchasing behaviors. A recommendation system trained on old data might start making inaccurate suggestions because the products or services people are interested in have changed.

- **Data Quality Issues:** The quality of data can deteriorate over time due to various reasons, such as the introduction of errors, increased noise, or inconsistencies in how data is collected and processed. Poor data quality can mislead the model, causing it to make incorrect predictions.

- **Feature Evolution:** The model's features can change in relevance and importance. For example, in a model predicting housing prices, features like proximity to public transport become more or less important over time due to infrastructure developments.

- **Introduction of New Data Sources:** Adding new data sources that are not part of the original training set can introduce variations the model cannot handle. As expected, this leads to inconsistencies and reduced accuracy in the model’s predictions.

- **Technological Advances:** New technologies can create data significantly different from what the model was trained on. For example, introducing high-resolution sensors in an imaging application might produce more detailed data that the existing model cannot effectively process.

- **Sampling Bias:** Over time, the data collected might become biased or non-representative of the target population. For instance, if a model was trained on a diverse dataset but newer data comes from a narrower group, the model’s performance can degrade due to this sampling bias.

## Types of Model Drift

There are two main types of model drift.

### Concept Drift

Concept drift occurs when the relationship between the input data and the target variable changes over time. This shift means that the patterns, rules, and relationships the model learned during its initial training may no longer hold for new data, resulting in decreased accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions.

Concept drift can arise in various forms, including **sudden drift**, where there is a quick and abrupt change in the data distribution, such as a regulatory change altering market conditions and impacting a financial model. **Incremental drift** involves gradual changes in the data distribution over time, like evolving consumer preferences affecting sales prediction models.

**Recurring drift** involves patterns that repeat over time, such as seasonal changes in demand for certain products impacting inventory management models. Finally, **Blip drift** refers to temporary changes that revert to the original state, such as a temporary surge in social media activity due to a specific event that doesn’t persist over time.

Detecting concept drift requires ongoing monitoring of the model's performance metrics. Methods such as statistical tests, performance comparison with a holdout set, or drift detection algorithms like the Page-Hinkley test or CUSUM can help identify when a model's accuracy starts to degrade. Once detected, the model may need retraining with more recent data to restore its performance.

### Data Drift

Data drift, also known as covariate shift, happens when the statistical properties of the input data change over time, even if the relationship between input and output remains stable. This type of drift can occur due to several reasons:


- **Changes in Data Collection:** Alterations in how data is gathered can lead to shifts in data properties. For instance, switching from manual data entry to automated data collection can introduce new patterns or noise.

- **Introduction of New Features:** Adding or altering new features can change the input data distribution. For example, adding new demographic features to a customer database can impact a marketing model.

- **Changes in User Behavior:** Evolving user preferences or behaviors can shift the input data distribution. For example, changes in online shopping habits can affect recommendation systems.

- **External Factors:** Economic shifts, pandemics, or natural disasters can significantly change the input data distribution.

Monitoring data drift involves tracking the statistical properties of the input data over time, such as mean, variance, and distribution shapes.

Techniques like the population stability index (PSI), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, and multivariate distance measures can help identify data drift. Detecting data drift might require retraining or adjusting the model to ensure it works well with the new data.

Addressing concepts and data drift is essential for keeping machine-learning models reliable and accurate in changing environments. Regularly monitoring, quickly detecting, and updating models as needed are vital strategies to handle these drifts effectively.

## How to Detect Model Drift

Spotting model drift is critical to keeping machine learning models accurate and reliable. Here are some ways to detect model decay in machine learning.

**Model-Based Approach:** This method uses a machine learning model to determine if the incoming input data has changed or drifted.

**Statistical Tests:** Various statistical tests can detect data drift, which is generally categorized into three main types:

### 1. Machine Learning Model-Based Approach

This approach uses machine learning models specifically designed to detect changes in the input data over time. These models are trained on historical data to understand the normal patterns and distributions. When new data comes in, the model compares it against these learned patterns to identify deviations. For example:


- **Autoencoders:** These are neural networks trained to compress and then reconstruct data. If the reconstruction error (the difference between the original data and its reconstruction) becomes significantly larger, it indicates that the new data differs from the training data, signaling potential drift.

- **Drift Detection Models:** Models like ADWIN (Adaptive Windowing) or DDM (Drift Detection Method) can be employed. These models are designed to work online, continuously monitoring the data stream for changes.

- **Ensemble Models:** Combining multiple models to monitor different aspects of the data can improve detection accuracy. For instance, an ensemble could include models monitoring statistical properties and structural changes in the data.

### 2. Statistical Tests

Statistical tests are commonly used to detect data drift by analyzing the properties of the data distribution. These tests can be categorized into three main groups:

**Sequential Analysis Methods:**


- Page-Hinkley Test: This method detects changes in the mean of a sequence of observations. It is suitable for scenarios where data arrives sequentially, and early drift detection is crucial.

- CUSUM (Cumulative Sum Control Chart): This method detects shifts in the mean value of a monitored process over time. It is effective for identifying small and consistent changes in the data.

**Custom Models to Detect Drift**


- Population Stability Index (PSI): PSI measures the expected and actual data distribution shift. A higher PSI value indicates a significant change in the data distribution.

- KL Divergence: Kullback-Leibler divergence measures the difference between two probability distributions. It can be used to compare new data distribution with the training data.

- Chi-Square Test: This test compares the observed data frequencies with the expected frequencies. It is helpful for categorical data to detect changes in distribution.

**Time Distribution Methods:**


- Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test: This non-parametric test compares the cumulative distributions of two datasets. It effectively detects differences in the distribution of continuous data over time.

- Mann-Whitney U Test: This test compares the ranks of two independent samples to determine if they come from the same distribution. It is suitable for detecting drift in non-parametric data.

- T-Test: This test compares the means of two groups to identify significant differences. It is useful for detecting drift in normally distributed data.

These approaches and tests provide a comprehensive toolkit for detecting data drift, each suitable for different data and drift patterns. By combining these methods, organizations can ensure their machine-learning models remain accurate and reliable.

## How to Reduce Model Drift

There are multiple solutions to reducing model drift. Here are some of the most common.

### Selecting the Appropriate Metrics

Each machine learning model requires distinct evaluation and monitoring metrics to reflect its performance accurately. Establishing an appropriate baseline performance is essential for comparing metric values effectively. The selected metrics should be in harmony with the specific objectives and features of the model. For example,


- Classification Models: These are best evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, which help measure how well the model differentiates between different classes.

- Regression Models: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared are used to assess these models. These metrics focus on the difference between the predicted and actual values.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models: For these models, metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity are commonly used. These metrics evaluate the quality and relevance of generated text against reference texts.

### Quality Data Checks

Accurate data ensures your machine-learning model works well. To achieve this, it's essential to implement good data quality checks. These checks help find and fix errors, inconsistencies, or missing values that could affect how the model learns and makes predictions.

Data visualization tools and interactive dashboards can help you monitor data quality over time. These tools make it easier to spot problems and ensure your data stays clean and reliable, leading to better model performance.

### Metric Monitoring

Regularly tracking your model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve, is crucial for spotting deviations from expected performance. This can be accomplished with automated monitoring tools or by manually reviewing model predictions and performance reports. Keeping an eye on these metrics helps ensure your model remains accurate and reliable over time.

### Retraining and Model Versioning

It is essential to regularly retrain models with updated data to keep them working well as data changes. This retraining can be done manually or automatically using MLOps techniques, which include continuous monitoring, training, and deployment right after training.

Model versioning is important for tracking different model versions' performance. It helps data scientists find the best model and return to older versions if needed. This way, you always use the most effective model and have a backup if a new version doesn’t work.
