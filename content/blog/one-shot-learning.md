Breezing through airport security is becoming a reality with the advent of automated passport scanners. Powered by advanced technologies like one-shot learning, these scanners enable quick and efficient identification with just a glance.

Unlike traditional facial recognition systems, which require thousands of images to learn, one-shot learning can identify and verify faces with just a single example, such as a passport photo.

Beyond facial recognition, one-shot learning has numerous use cases, including object recognition, handwriting analysis, and medical image classification, making it a promising technology for various applications. We discuss this and more in this blog.

## What is One-Shot Learning?

As hinted above, one-shot learning is a type of machine learning that needs only a small amount of data to recognize similarities between objects. With one-shot learning, the algorithm can learn from just one example per category instead of needing many.

The objective is straightforward: confirm or deny the scanned data. Essentially, it's a computer vision technique aimed at answering a single question: is this person who they say they are?

One-shot algorithms are often more straightforward than most computer vision models. The only difference is that traditional computer vision models access extensive training databases, which enhances their accuracy and training outcomes. On the other hand, one-shot algorithms work effectively with much smaller datasets, which is cost-effective.

## Importance of One-Shot Learning

- **Data Efficiency:** One-shot learning can recognize and categorize objects with only a few examples, which is particularly advantageous when acquiring large datasets. This efficiency is crucial in fields like rare disease diagnosis, where examples are inherently limited.

- **Cost-Effective:** Traditional machine learning models often require vast amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to gather. One-shot learning reduces the need for extensive data collection and labeling efforts, leading to significant cost savings and faster deployment times.

- **Quick Adaptation:** With minimal data, one-shot learning models can quickly adapt to new classes or categories. This ability is essential for dynamic environments where new objects or categories frequently emerge, such as security surveillance, where new threats need immediate recognition.

- **Enhanced Performance in Low-Data Situations:** Data is often scarce in many real-world applications, especially in medical and security fields. One-shot learning excels in these low-data situations, providing reliable performance and accurate predictions when traditional models might struggle due to insufficient training data.

## How One-shot Learning Works

Most computer vision models focus on classification or object identification. However, one-shot learning takes a different approach.

It's a simple comparison task where the main goal is to check if a given image matches an existing one in a database. This straightforward process makes it easy to determine if the presented image is the same as the stored one.

A neural network - Siamese Neural Networks - or computer vision model compares the two data points and generates a “yes” or “no” answer.

### Siamese Neural Networks in One-Shot Learning

Siamese neural networks (SNNs) are a specialized form of [convolutional neural networks (CNNs)](https://pareto.ai/blog/convolutional-neural-networks) used in one-shot learning.

While traditional CNNs adjust their parameters during training to accurately classify each image, Siamese neural networks are designed to measure the distance between the features of two input images. This unique approach allows them to determine the similarity between images.

Siamese neural networks use two identical networks to process inputs. These networks are trained on the same data and work together to compare the inputs. The final result is based on how similar the two inputs are.

For example, if you have two images of faces, each network processes one image. Then, the networks compare the features of the two faces to determine whether they are of the same person.

Training a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) for one-shot learning involves two main stages: verification and generalization.

- **Verification stage:** This stage uses the triplet loss function. The model receives three images: an anchor, a positive image, and a negative image. The encoded features of the anchor and positive images are very similar, while the negative image features differ. To improve model training, the triplets (anchor, positive, and negative images) should look relatively similar, which helps the model learn from challenging examples that are "hard to recognize."

- **Generalization stage:** The model is trained to assess the probability that input pairs belong to the same class. During this step, it's crucial to provide the model with images where the differences are subtle and hard to recognize. Increasing the complexity of these comparisons accelerates the model's learning process, helping it better distinguish between similar-looking classes.

### Advantages of SNNs for one-shot learning

SNNs have some advantages over its counterpart convolutional neural networks.

- SNNs excel in recognizing faces, objects, and diverse visual content, surpassing other neural network architectures.

- They demonstrate adaptability, thriving on vast and limited datasets without requiring extensive re-training for new image categories.

- SNNs exhibit parameter harmonization, enhancing their generalization ability across similar, distinct images.

## Difference between Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning

Besides one-shot learning, there are also other methods where you only need a few examples (few-shot learning) or even none at all (zero-shot learning).

[Few-shot learning](https://pareto.ai/blog/few-shot-learning) is essentially a version of the one-shot learning model but with a few more training images available.

[Zero-shot learning](https://pareto.ai/blog/zero-short-learning) is about sorting things into groups, even when you don't have any examples to learn from. Instead of pictures, you use descriptions or features. It's like reading about a dog in a book and then recognizing it in a photo later on. Here’s a detailed breakdown that differentiates the three learning models.

Aspect
Zero-Shot Learning
One-shot Learning
Few-Shot Learning




definition
Enables a model to recognize and classify objects or categories that it has never seen before

Allows a model to learn information about object classes from only a single example.

The model learns to recognize categories from a very small number of examples, typically ranging from a few to several dozen.



How it Works
Uses semantic understanding and generalization, relying on knowledge transfer from known classes to infer properties of unseen classes based on their descriptions or relationships.

Uses methods like Siamese neural networks or prototypical networks, which compare the features of a single example with those of other examples to determine similarity.

Involves meta-learning, where the model is trained on a variety of tasks to learn how to learn efficiently from few examples.



Example
A model trained to recognize cats and dogs can also identify a tiger by understanding that a tiger is similar to a cat in certain features.

A facial recognition system can identify a person from just one image by comparing it to stored images.

A model can be trained to identify new species of plants with only five images per species, leveraging its previous learning experience on other related tasks.



Data Requirement 
No examples of the new class are needed.

Only one example of the new class is needed.

A small number of examples (a few to several dozen) are needed.


Generalization Capability
Relies heavily on semantic understanding and relationships between known and unknown classes
Focuses on learning to compare and match features from a single example.

Utilizes previous experience to generalize from a small number of examples.



application scenario
Useful in scenarios where collecting labeled data for new classes is impossible or impractica
Ideal for tasks where acquiring many examples is difficult, such as biometric identification.

Effective in situations where some examples are available but obtaining a large dataset is still challenging, like rare disease diagnosis or new product identification.




## One-Shot Learning Use Cases

Here’s a breakdown of some applications of one-shot learning.

- **Facial Recognition:** One-shot learning allows systems to identify people using just one image, which is very helpful for security systems and personal device authentication. This technology can recognize a person's face with very little training data, making identification quick and reliable.

- **Object Recognition:** In scenarios such as automated inspection systems and robotics, one-shot learning allows for the recognition and classification of objects with minimal examples. This capability is essential for tasks like quality control in manufacturing, where the system can quickly adapt to new objects or defects without extensive retraining.

- **Medical Imaging:** One-shot learning can revolutionize medical diagnostics by identifying rare diseases or conditions from limited medical images. This approach aids in early and accurate diagnosis, especially in cases where gathering a large dataset is challenging due to the condition's rarity.

- **Handwriting Analysis:** This application is beneficial in automated form processing and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems. One-shot learning enables the recognition of handwritten characters or words from a single example, improving the accuracy and efficiency of document digitization.

- **Speech Recognition:** One-shot learning allows for the identification and verification of speakers from a single audio sample. This is particularly useful in voice authentication systems, providing secure and quick verification for access control or user authentication in various applications.

- **Biometric Authentication:** By using unique biological traits such as iris scans or fingerprints, one-shot learning can verify identity with minimal data. This enhances security in applications like secure access systems, banking, and personal device security, where traditional methods may be impractical.

- **Signature Verification:** One-shot learning can authenticate signatures with minimal samples, which is crucial for financial transactions and legal documents. This technology ensures the security and integrity of important documents by accurately verifying the authenticity of signatures.

The Takeaway

## The Takeaway

The main upside of one-shot learning is that it classifies images by assessing their similarities rather than analyzing numerous features. This approach significantly cuts down on computational costs and training time.

In practical applications, one-shot learning is promising, especially in face recognition scenarios, such as managing access at exhibitions or identifying faces in old manuscripts.

The technology is continually evolving. Innovations like ‘less than one ’ shot learning and memory-augmented neural networks represent the future of deep learning, paving the way for its broader integration into everyday life.
