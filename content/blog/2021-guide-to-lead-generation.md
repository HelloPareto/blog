One of the main goals of every business is to increase their customer base. It is one of the determining factors of a company’s success. Without a client base, your company is most likely to fail. 

To succeed, you have to grow your user base. And, in order to increase the number of customers, you must pay attention to getting quality leads who have the potential to turn into paying customers. This is where the importance of lead generation services comes in. 

[Lead generation](https://deskubots.com/blogs/chatbot-lead-generation-strategies/) one of the earliest steps in any sales and/or marketing strategy. It is the process of identifying the right target market and scraping market information to proceed to the next step of the strategy - cold calling, email marketing, target advertising, and more. 

## What is a lead and why you need it

In a sales context, a lead is exactly what it sounds like - a potential prospect for your business. Some businesses and companies define a lead in different ways - it could be a contact that has already been defined as a prospective customer, or just any contact. What is important to note is that all leads have a potential to be a paying customer of your product or service.



This makes leads super important because it gives us an idea of who we’re targeting to pay for our goods and services. Without leads, most businesses will also not have the sales/customers needed to keep the lights on and continue to grow.

With quality leads, you’ll be able to improve your ROI and achieve higher customer satisfaction when matching your product to your target market.



## What is lead generation

Okay, so you know what a lead is and why it’s important to any business at any stage of their growth. The next question would be, “How do I find these potential prospects?”

Lead generation is an essential business process that helps attract potential prospects and converts them into people who have an interest in what you’re offering. There are many different strategies and approaches such as:


- Email marketing

- Social media marketing

- Blogging

- Live events

- Landing Pages

In particular, email marketing is often the most accessible with the lowest upfront cost. This is obviously dependant on industry but as a whole, it allows startups and SMBs (Small and Medium Businesses) to get started on outreach.



Services like Pareto specialize in finding these leads for companies. By providing information on what target group companies want to go after, Pareto is able to quickly generate a list of companies/individuals and their contact info. From there, companies can set up email drip campaigns and cadences that can get the key information on what they do into these users inboxes.

## Outsourcing lead generation

Sourcing leads and finding information like personal emails, LinkedIn URLs, social media handles, and phone numbers can be extremely time consuming. As the founder or an early stage member of a startup/small business, you’re already strapped for time.



There are many high level decisions such as vision setting, strategy, finances, and branding that need to be attended to. These are mission crucial processes and often directly contribute to the whether or not a business succeeds its first year.



Unlike with lead generation [lead generation](https://deskubots.com/blogs/chatbot-lead-generation-strategies/) processes such as strategy and branding require consistent high level planning and structuring. This makes it difficult to outsource to third parties/companies that are not fully integrated within your organization.
