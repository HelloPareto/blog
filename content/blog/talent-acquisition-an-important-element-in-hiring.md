One of the things you can find in every successful company is a group of highly skilled and dedicated personnel. No matter how good the company system is or how well it has been managed, nothing would ever work if the people behind it do not fit in. So how do we find the right person to hire? **Hiring top talent** starts with a great talent acquisition and recruitment process.

## Difference Between Recruitment And Talent Acquisition

**Talent acquisition** is a process of attracting, finding, and hiring skilled personnel to meet an organization’s labor requirements. 

A lot of people, even some human resource professionals, confuse talent acquisition with recruitment. While the two are almost synonymous and both crucial in hiring top talent, there are some differences that you should be aware of.

Recruitment is reactive and tactical while talent acquisition is proactive and strategic. The former only requires short-term planning as it also requires fast results. It focuses on filling up company vacancies. On the other hand, the latter requires long-term planning for it to be effective. It is the ongoing process of finding the right candidate with a specific skillset who will help drive the growth of the company. Hiring top talent requires a good talent acquisition strategy.

## 8 Effective Talent Acquisition Methods

There are several methods you can use to find the right talent for your company. Each company is different. The method used by the other company may not apply to yours. You can choose a few of these methods or mix them all up to customize your company’s needs. 

### 1. Hiring top talent within the industry. 

It is a common practice among big companies to consider and offer a position to outstanding employees of competitors or from other related organizations. You will likely find the person with the right attribute and experiences from here.

### 2. Hiring through referrals.

Current employees can be channels of possible candidates. Involving them with the recruitment process through the company’s referral program may prove to be a quick and effective method in finding the best talent for the company’s current vacancies.

### 3. Identifying talented freelancers

Not all talented individuals are in the corporate world. Some are working as freelancers. Keep an eye on promising freelancers. If you think their skills will help you grow your business, convince them to join your team by offering a difficult-to-resist package. When creating the best deal for freelancers, take into consideration that what matters most to them is flexibility and the opportunity to work remotely.

### 4. Grooming fresh graduates for future roles

Many fresh graduates can take on a huge responsibility even in their early careers. You can target top graduates and offer them a role where they can utilize their talents. You can also run attractive internship programs that will attract top graduates to join your team. If their performance during their internship program is satisfactory, you can offer them a long-term position.

### Finding the right talent in other cities or countries

Talent knows no boundaries. There are many skilled candidates that come from all over the world. The good thing about hiring from other cities or countries is that they bring in fresh ideas - ideas that have not been fully utilized by other companies in your city. When you find a candidate outside your city, offer a great relocation package to increase the chances of them taking the position.

### 6. Contacting previous employees

Rehiring a former employee, commonly called a boomerang employee, has its advantages and disadvantages. Rehiring a previous employee requires less time of training as they already know the company and its processes. They can also bring in fresh ideas from their new work. However, be sure to have a rehire policy to set things straight.

### 7. Joining Job Recruitment Events

Events such as job fairs, workshops, and career counseling are full of job hunters who could be skilled or complete newbies. These are great places to look for ideal candidates because of the number of people coming.

### 8. Hiring Internally

Most of the time, you do not have to look outside to find the best candidates for a senior position. Seek the best candidates within the company and provide training to prepare them for a future role. Hiring internally will also improve employee morale - it is a way of letting them know that they can expect professional growth within the company.

### 4. Attend events where you will most likely meet your potential candidate for a position

Events such as job fairs, workshops, and career seminars are places where a pool of potential candidates is present. Some may be currently employed while others are still seeking the right job.
