[Pareto](https://hellopareto.com/) CEO and Founder, Phoebe Yao today announces Pareto’s national certification as a Women's Business Enterprise by the Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC). 

Pareto, a first-of-its-kind human-in-the-loop automation platform aims to accelerate startup growth while providing meaningful work opportunities and economic empowerment for women in developing countries. 

“We are excited to be officially certified as a Woman-Owned Business Enterprise,” said Yao. “WBENC believes that diversity promotes innovation, opens doors, and creates partnerships that fuel the economy, and this reflects Pareto's own mission and core values. Diversity and inclusion have been integral to every step of building this global community of partners; from securing funding from female- and minority-led venture partners, to empowering women to enter the remote workforce & build a better female future. We're thrilled to join this inspiring organization, and we look forward to the new relationships and possibilities.” 

Yao studied human-centered engineering at Stanford and built human-in-the-loop systems at Microsoft Research in India before going on to found Pareto. While abroad, she noticed a disconnect between companies in need of talent and opportunities for capable, highly-skilled workers abroad. When she returned to Stanford, she recognized another problem: repetitive day-to-day operations were keeping entrepreneurs from successfully growing their businesses. Pareto combines human-in-the-loop automation with a managed team of highly-skilled women to ensure timely, quality-assured delivery of business tasks.

To date, Pareto has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs and small business owners offload busywork in every sector of business development, from product and sales to hiring and operations. Clients ping Pareto’s agile operations team whenever they have a task bogging them down, with no minimums required. Some of Pareto’s specialities include:


- Lead generation

- Market research

- Social media engagement

- Screening prospective hires

The WBENC Certification substantiates that a business is 51 percent owned, controlled, operated and managed by a woman or women. This premier certification is accepted by more than 1,000 corporations, including America’s top brands, states, cities and other entities. It also opens the door for new business opportunities between WOSBs and WBENC corporate members and government agencies.
