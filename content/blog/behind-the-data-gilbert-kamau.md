In this month’s edition of Behind the Data, we’re excited to feature Gilbert Kamau—a data scientist and dedicated AI trainer whose journey from actuarial science to cutting-edge AI work is packed with insights. Gilbert opens up about the challenges and rewards of balancing AI projects with his career, shares his thoughts on the future of AI in the job market, and reflects on his learning curve in data labeling. He also offers an honest take on the highs and lows of task availability, the importance of community, and the importance of staying curious and persistence.

Hi Gilbert! Could you start by telling us a bit about yourself?

I’m a son, brother, and, as of October 16th, a new uncle to two wonderful nephews! My faith in Christ guides me, and I consider myself industrious and driven. I have a passion for problem-solving, particularly when it involves creative thinking. I enjoy expanding my knowledge about my surroundings and nurturing my mental and spiritual well-being through various sources like articles, books, and social media. Oh, I am also a Chelsea FC fan.

What’s your professional background?

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science. As a dedicated and accomplished professional, I have a strong track record in data science and operations management within the technology sector. With expertise in data science and analytics, I employ advanced techniques such as Python, SQL, Power BI, and computer vision to derive insights and foster innovation. My experience as a Data Scientist, Operations Team Lead, and Product Operations Lead has honed my ability to manage complex projects from inception to delivery. Additionally, I teach Math and Data Science as a part-time gig and I am also a Trusted Worker/AI Trainer at Pareto.AI.

How did you hear about Pareto.AI?

In October 2023, a colleague noticed me preparing for some exams and mentioned this opportunity to me that would let me be my creative self and still be paid for it. It was just a casual conversation, and I honestly didn’t think I’d make it. Then, in January 2024, I received an email inviting me to participate in Project Krypton. The rest is history.

What were your initial thoughts about working as an AI trainer?

I felt a mix of excitement and confusion. I was thrilled about the opportunity to work on something with a global impact, but I was also puzzled because there wasn’t much information about Pareto.ai online. I wasn’t sure if it was genuine or just a bluff. However, I decided to give it some time, and eventually, things worked out.

Before getting onboarded, did you have any preconceptions about what data labeling is like?

Yes, I did have some preconceptions about data labeling. With my background in data science and insights from friends who have worked in various data labeling companies, I had a general idea of what to expect.

Did you face a learning curve when you started your first AI training project? How did you navigate this?

Not really. I was already familiar with AI training, so the only new aspect for me was learning how to navigate the software systems that Pareto had implemented. Fortunately, these systems were user-friendly, making the transition quite smooth.

How do you manage to integrate your AI projects into your busy schedule?

Balancing daily life with my tasks at Pareto can be challenging, much like any part-time job. But I truly enjoy the hustle. It’s all about learning to be responsible and maintaining a schedule for every aspect of my life. I dedicate much of my free time, especially on weekends, to Pareto tasks. While unexpected events do arise, I strive to keep my commitments manageable, ensuring I can focus on what truly matters. Ultimately, having a structured schedule and distancing myself from unnecessary distractions has made a significant difference for me.

What parts of the job do you find most enjoyable?
I truly enjoy many aspects of my role as an AI trainer at Pareto. This experience has shown me that I can push myself to achieve great things. While I always believed in my potential, this opportunity has helped me realize just how capable I really am. I’ve also had the pleasure of working alongside amazing people like Gerrith, Keith Peters, and Amanda Ewing. Their dedication to excellence inspires me to strive for more. Additionally, I appreciate the rewards that come with working at Pareto, whether it’s financial compensation or the recognition I receive for my efforts.

Are there aspects of the job you find less appealing? You can be brutally honest.

One of my main concerns as a trainer at Pareto is the inconsistency in task assignments. For instance, there was a stretch, that I call a 'winter season', between May and September this year where I had no tasks, which was understandably frustrating. However, I’ve seen that things tend to improve over time. I have confidence in Phoebe and her team; they are always on the lookout for clients, ensuring we eventually have projects to work on.

Would you say that working on AI projects has helped you with your skills, passions, or career goals?

Oh absolutely! Working on AI projects has significantly enhanced my skills, passions, and career goals. For instance, tasks like Boron, which focused heavily on math, helped me sharpen my mathematical abilities. I’ve gained a deeper appreciation for AI; it’s much more than the marketing hype suggests. There’s a complex world happening behind the scenes to make AI better. This has reinforced the idea that data is indeed the new oil. Witnessing how much companies invest in credible data highlights its critical importance.

The principle of "garbage in, garbage out" truly resonates with me. There’s a Swahili saying that goes, "He who wants what's under the bed must be willing to bow down to get it," which perfectly illustrates that to develop a high-quality model, it’s only natural for companies to invest in quality data. Additionally, I’ve learned a lot from the work ethic of my colleagues at Pareto, which has equipped me to navigate my career more effectively, applying both soft and hard skills to excel in my tasks.

What are your views on the future impact of AI on the job market? Do you think AI will take away jobs?

This is a question that those in the data field are all too familiar with. It’s still early to predict just how far AI will evolve, especially with emerging advancements like Quantum AI, which is rapidly gaining traction. While I see AI primarily as an assistant for daily human tasks, it’s undeniable that some jobs are at risk. The world is increasingly resembling a survival-of-the-fittest landscape, where AI can either position you as the hunter or the hunted.

I believe that jobs requiring creativity and critical thinking—like rocket engineering, medicine, and law—are less likely to be fully replaced by AI. Overall, I think it’s crucial to implement strict regulatory measures to govern AI’s development and application. As Newton's principle suggests, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Just as AI can be harnessed for good, it can also be misused. Let’s give it a bit more time to see how things will pan out.

If you could suggest improvements for Pareto, what would they be?

I genuinely appreciate that the community is still growing and evolving. A lot is happening now, and I’m confident that even more developments will take place in the future to help Pareto reach its full potential. I suggested this before, but I hope Pareto will actively invest in upskilling its trainers. Organizing training sessions and webinars on AI topics would greatly enhance our understanding and appreciation of our work. Additionally, introducing tailored Pareto courses, aside from the written articles, would be a good initiative.

Outside of projects, what has your experience been like with the community? Have you had a chance to interact with other AI trainers on Discord or make new friends?

The community is fantastic; I’ve had the pleasure of meeting some great people. I appreciate that senior profiles like Phoebe take the time to respond to questions in the various Discord channels. The culture of treating everyone equally resonates with me, and I truly value that.

Do you have any advice for the larger AI trainer community that wants to get better at this role and contribute more effectively?

To the larger AI trainer community, two things, patience, and hard work- these two will give you a name. Keep at it!! Have the drive to do impactful work first, the aftermath is usually beautiful. When Pareto notices you, they always come looking for you.

Any final thoughts you’d like to share with us today?

At Pareto, everyone is treated equally, regardless of race, gender, or ethnicity. While there is indeed stiff competition, given its status as a global organization, there’s no reason to doubt your capabilities. If you put forth your best effort, that is more than enough to get you noticed!
