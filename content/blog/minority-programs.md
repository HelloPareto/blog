In recent weeks, violent and racist attacks against members of the Black community have forced the world to reckon with the structural and systemic racism that Black people have experienced for generations. This systemic racism permeates every aspect of life, from interactions with law enforcement, to access to healthcare, education, and entrepreneurial opportunity.

As a global, female-founded company unified by our drive to empower entrepreneurs, Pareto is committed to translating the current outrage surrounding racial inequity into enduring, meaningful change. 

To start, we've curated a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gjs5WkfLul11ye5RbF0bFGAkR4RMMqKwQEnhAxQ2Ijc/edit) of 40+ Entrepreneurial Programs for Minority Founders. In providing benefits like capital, advisory support, and amplification, we trust that each of these programs will help catalyze change for those who need it most.
