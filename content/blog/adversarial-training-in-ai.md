The meteoric rise of AI has revolutionized numerous aspects of life, from facial recognition to self-driving cars. However, with great power comes great vulnerability.

Enter adversarial attacks, malicious attempts to manipulate AI models into making wrong decisions. In this blog, we’ll explore adversarial training, a critical safeguard against such attacks, enhancing AI's robustness and security.

## What is adversarial training?

In simple terms, adversarial training in the context of artificial intelligence is like preparing a computer system to be more street-smart. Just as we learn from experiences and adapt to unexpected situations, adversarial training helps AI systems become better at handling tricky or deceptive scenarios.

Imagine you're teaching a computer to recognize pictures of cats. Adversarial training involves deliberately showing the computer slightly altered images that are designed to confuse it, like adding subtle distortions or changes that are hard to notice. By exposing the AI to these tricky examples during its training, it learns to be more robust and less likely to be fooled by similar tricks in the real world.

So, adversarial training is like giving AI a set of challenges during its learning process, making it more resilient and better equipped to handle unexpected situations or attempts to manipulate its decision-making. It's a way of toughening up AI systems to be more accurate and reliable in the face of malicious scenarios.

## How adversarial training works

Imagine you're training a guard dog. You wouldn't just present friendly strangers, you'd also expose it to potential intruders in various disguises to prepare it for real threats. Adversarial training works similarly, but with AI models and "deceptive" data. Let's break it down:

### 1. Adversarial example generation

The model starts with its regular training data, like pictures of cats and dogs. However, there is a twist: A specialized algorithm takes these normal examples and adds tiny, carefully crafted modifications. These are the "deceptive" counterparts, like a cat image with subtle changes that make it look like a dog to the model. These modifications are often imperceptible to humans but can significantly confuse the AI.

### 2. Model vs. Adversary

Attack: The generated adversarial example is fed to the model. Let's say it's the "cat-dog" image.

Defense: The model makes its prediction, initially classifying it as a cat (due to its limited training).

Feedback loop: Here's the key. The true label (dog) and the model's wrong prediction are fed back. This "teaches" the model that its initial prediction was incorrect and helps it adjust its internal parameters to better recognize such disguised examples in the future.

### 3. Continuous learning

This process doesn't stop at one example. The model encounters multiple adversarial examples, each targeting different aspects of its decision-making. With each encounter, it refines its ability to identify and resist such manipulations.

### 4. Generalization and robustness

The beauty of adversarial training lies in its hidden benefit. By constantly facing "deceptive" data, the model doesn't just learn to resist specific attacks; it develops a more general ability to handle unexpected variations and noise in real-world data. This leads to improved overall robustness and generalization performance.

## Applications of adversarial training

While the defensive power of adversarial training against malicious attacks is widely recognized, its applications extend far beyond security, shaping various aspects of AI development. Here's a look at some common applications:

- **Domain Adaptation:** By incorporating domain-specific adversarial examples, models can adapt to new environments or tasks more effectively, generalizing their knowledge better and avoiding overfitting [overfitting](https://pareto.ai/blog/underfitting-and-overfitting) to specific training data.

- **Data Scarcity:** Generating adversarial examples can artificially "augment" limited training data, enriching the model's experience and improving its performance, especially in domains where large datasets are hard to obtain.

- **Computer vision**Training image recognition models with adversarial examples helps them resist manipulations like adding subtle noise or adversarial patches, improving their accuracy and robustness in real-world applications like self-driving cars and facial recognition.

- **Speech recognition:** Training speech recognition models with adversarial audio examples helps them resist background noise, accents, or manipulated speech, leading to more accurate and reliable voice assistants and automated transcription systems.

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**These leverage adversarial training principles to create increasingly realistic and diverse data, fostering creative applications like generating new images, music, or writing styles.

## Generating Adversarial Examples

Adversarial examples originate from modifying a correctly recognized image with subtle distortions, leading a machine learning model to classify the altered image incorrectly. These small, intentional changes are designed to exploit the vulnerabilities in the model’s ability to interpret data accurately.

Generating adversarial examples involves crafting inputs to a machine-learning model intentionally designed to deceive it. Here's an overview of the three main methods

### Gradient-based methods

This approach involves computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input and then making small perturbations to the input in the direction that maximizes the loss. Here’s how the process works.

- Start with a legitimate input example.

- Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input.

- Adjust the input in the direction that increases the loss (i.e., misclassifies the example).

- Repeat the process until the desired misclassification level is achieved or convergence criteria are met.

### Genetic algorithms

Genetic algorithms mimic the process of natural selection to evolve adversarial examples.

- Initialize a population of candidate adversarial examples randomly or with slight modifications to legitimate examples.

- Evaluate each candidate by measuring its effectiveness in deceiving the model.
Select the best-performing candidates (based on a fitness function).

- Apply genetic operations such as mutation and crossover to create new candidate examples.

- Repeat the process iteratively until convergence or a stopping criterion is met.

### Reinforcement Learning

[reinforcement learning](https://pareto.ai/blog/what-is-rlhf), an agent learns to generate adversarial examples by interacting with the model and receiving feedback on the success of its attempts.

- The agent starts with an initial input example and takes action to modify it.
After each modification, the model evaluates the resulting example and provides feedback (e.g., reward signal) based on its effectiveness in deceiving the model.

- The agent learns from this feedback to adjust its strategy for generating adversarial examples.

- Repeat the process iteratively, with the agent gradually improving its ability to craft effective adversarial examples through trial and error.

Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on factors such as the target model architecture, the availability of computational resources, and the specific goals of the attack.

## Types of Adversarial Attacks on Machine Learning Models

Adversarial attacks are classified into two categories.

### Black-Box Attacks

In this category, the attacker doesn't know much, if anything, about the internal workings of the AI model they're targeting. They can only interact with the model by giving it inputs and seeing what outputs it gives back. The goal is to create adversarial examples to trick the model without access to its inner settings or the data it was trained on.

These attacks often use transferability, where adversarial examples made for one model are used to deceive another similar model. The attacker can develop misled inputs by observing how the target model reacts.

### White-Box Attacks

In a white-box attack, the attacker knows everything about the AI model they are targeting, including how it's built, what data it was trained on, and its settings. They can get into the model, look around, and figure out how to trick it by making special inputs that confuse it. White-box attacks are usually very effective since the attacker has all this information.

Multiple types of adversarial attacks are based on these two categories as follows.

#### Evasion Attacks

These attacks occur during the inference phase of a model, where the attacker modifies input data so that the model makes incorrect predictions while the input still appears normal to human observers. For example, subtly altering an image to cause a machine learning model to misclassify it. The modifications exploit specific weaknesses in the model's decision boundaries.

#### Poisoning Attacks

This attack type targets a machine-learning model's training phase. The attacker injects malicious data into the training set, which can subtly alter the model's parameters. As a result, the model learns incorrect behaviours or creates vulnerabilities that can be exploited once the model is deployed. Poisoning can be aimed at degrading overall performance or inducing specific errors.

#### Model Extraction Attacks

In these attacks, the adversary aims to create a nearly identical replica of the target model using its queries and corresponding outputs. This could be done by repeatedly querying the model to learn its structure and behaviour. The extracted model can then be used for more attacks, like discovering other vulnerabilities without risking detection on the actual model.

#### Model Inversion Attacks

These attacks focus on extracting sensitive or proprietary information about its training data from the model. By analysing the model’s outputs and possibly its structure, attackers can infer details about the input data used to train the model, potentially reconstructing features of the training data itself.

#### Model Inversion Attacks

This type of attack determines whether a particular data record was used in the model’s training dataset. By observing the model's predictions and comparing them to expected predictions for known training and non-training data, an attacker can infer the likelihood of specific data being included in the training set, potentially revealing sensitive information.

## Defence Mechanisms Against Adversarial Attacks

Adversarial machine learning is an escalating danger that targets ubiquitous flaws in ML frameworks. Even cutting-edge AI technologies are not immune to breaches by malicious entities.

There's no absolute solution for defending against these ML attacks. However, teams managing ML operations can adopt certain strategies to combat these risks. Some of these include:

- **Adversarial Training:** This involves including adversarial examples during the training phase. By exposing the model to these perturbed inputs, it learns to classify them correctly, thereby becoming more resilient to similar attacks in the future.

- **Defensive Distillation:** This technique trains a model to output softened probabilities rather than hard labels, making it harder for attackers to derive useful gradient information to craft adversarial inputs. A second model is then trained on these probabilities, effectively distilling the knowledge but obscuring useful gradients.

- **Feature Squeezing:** By reducing the colour depth of images or applying other transformations that compress the input space, feature squeezing can limit the effectiveness of slight perturbations, which are the hallmarks of many adversarial examples.

- **Input Reconstruction:** This defence uses autoencoders or other reconstructive models to clean or reconstruct incoming inputs before they reach the main model. This helps in removing any adversarial noise added to the input.

- **Robustness Testing:** Regularly testing the model with new adversarial examples can help identify vulnerabilities. This continuous testing ensures that the model can withstand evolving adversarial tactics.

## Examples of adversarial machine learning in the modern world

Self-driving cars: Adversarial training helped Tesla cars better differentiate stop signs from visually similar objects, potentially saving lives.

Facial recognition: Apple, trained with adversarial examples, achieved over 99% accuracy in facial recognition systems, demonstrating the technique's effectiveness in improving real-world performance.

Spam filtering: Gmail utilizes adversarial training to detect and block increasingly sophisticated phishing emails, protecting users from cyberattacks.
